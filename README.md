# MongoDB $in operator with empty array

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The `$in` operator is intended to filter documents where the specified field matches any value within the provided array. When an empty array is used, the query unexpectedly returns no results, even if the field exists in the documents.

## The Bug

The following code shows the incorrect usage of the `$in` operator with an empty array.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage of $in operator with an empty array
db.collection.find({field: {$in: []}});
```

This query will always return an empty result set, regardless of the contents of the collection.

## The Solution

To correctly handle situations where the input array might be empty, it's necessary to check for the array's emptiness and modify the query accordingly.

One solution would be to adjust the query based on whether the array is empty.  If empty, return all documents; otherwise, perform the $in query.
